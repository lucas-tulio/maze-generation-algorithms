Slick2D Maze
============

Java maze generator and solver.

The algorithm will generate a 2D maze and use A* to solve it. It's using [lwjgl](http://lwjgl.org/) and [Slick2D](http://slick.ninjacave.com/) to render the maze.

* Press R to generate another maze
* Use W, A, S and D to move the camera around
* Use = and - to increase and decrease the zoom
